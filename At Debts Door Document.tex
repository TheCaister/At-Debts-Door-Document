\section{INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW \label{intro}}
At Debt’s Door(or A.D.D) is a fast paced shooter/strategy game. The goal of the game is to sneak in and infiltrate various locations such as banks, jewellery stores etc., and loot as much as you can without getting caught by the police that oppose you. This takes place from a top-down perspective where the camera follows the player as he carries out these heists. Many beneficial tools and weapons can be acquired and earned throughout the game to help ease the players pursuits.
\bigbreak
While stealth is the opportune approach, it is not necessary. If he/she desires it, the player can choose brutal offensive assault instead. Weapons such as pistols and shotguns along with body armour help you carry out this risky task.

\subsection{STORY SUMMARISED \label{storysumm}}
A.D.D is set in modern America, where money rules and you, “The Player” live your life desperately trying to gather it. After some poor choices and even worse gambles, you find yourself in debt to the infamous Starman, America’s most renowned mob boss. Left with a limited time frame, “The Player” has no choice but to resort to a life of crime.

\section{STORY OVERVIEW \label{storyover}}
Starting from a simple robbery of a gas station, “The Player” quickly moves up the ladder and with the right equipment, high-end banks are ripe for the picking. All of this is essential of course, as the time frame in order to pay “Starman” creeps ever closer.
\bigbreak
These robberies are not easy tasks of course, as the cops that occupy and guard these banks are no pushovers. Once discovered, “The player” has limited time to escape with the loot before being knocked down by police.
\bigbreak
While the story is quite simple, a opening cutscene helps set the dark, grimy tone of the game and the urgency of acquiring the money. Through the game’s arms supplier, “The Dealer”, small snippets of Starman’s lore is discovered, helping you understand how a simple man became the monster that he is today.
\bigbreak
While there is a definitive ending for the game, there is also an ending where the player is unable to pay back the money owed in time. This helps show players there is consequences and punishment for failing the task at hand.

\section{GAME PROGRESSION \label{progression}}
Initially the player starts off with just his fists, which do minimal damage to enemies. This helps encourage stealth as a full frontal assault is not recommended with no equipment. Soon the player acquires a basic knife. This is an upgrade to damage but it also comes with durability, meaning it has limited use before breaking. Again this is to encourage stealth but it gives the player a fighting chance in emergency situations.
\bigbreak
After the first heist, “The Player” unlocks the shop, a sort of hub where items and weapons can be purchased from “The Dealer”. These weapons include but are not limited to guns such as shotguns and pistols for a deadlier approach, and aluminium baseball bats for a heavy increase in melee damage.
\bigbreak
Items include a lockpick, body armour for increased damage resistance, med-packs and a power drill to break through heavy doors.
 \bigbreak
All of these are purchased with the money and collectibles stolen from the heists. These collectibles come in the form of gems, gold bars, coins and cash that the player collects by walking over them doing the heist.
\bigbreak
These items and weapons make gameplay more varied as the number of approach and routes to take multiply exponentially. “The Player” must carefully balance buying upgrades to help him earn more money with the task of saving his money in order to pay back Starman.
